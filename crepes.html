    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
    <p>Makes 4 servings of 2 crepes each, takes 30 minutes to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
